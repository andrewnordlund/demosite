			<h2>What is the purpose of this site?</h2>
			<p>The purpose of this site utlimately is to demonstrate the necessity of human accessibility auditors.</p>
			<p>I will endeavor to show several examples of design patterns that won't be caught by automated accessibility auditing tools.  There will all be several examples of design patterns which conform to WCAG, but fail WCAG.</p>
			<h3>WCAG vs Accessibility</h3>
			<p>"Wait.  What?" you ask.  "How can something conform to WCAG, but not be accessible?"</p>
			<p>WCAG stands for "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines", and they're just that:  guidelines.</p>
			<p>WCAG lays out Success Criteria to be met which will increase the likelyhood of a website being accessible.  Accessibility could be reworded:  Usable by all.</p>
			<p>Accessibility is more subjective.  WCAG Conformance is more objective, but not entirely objective.  There is plenty of grey in WCAG conformance.
